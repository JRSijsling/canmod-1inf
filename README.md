# Description

This repository contains a mix Magma code for the preprint

Jeroen Sijsling  
*Canonical models of arithmetic (1; inf)-curves*

The code is in a fairly unpolished state. Most of the files in it can be run by using the command

```
load "[filename]";
```

in Magma, where [filename] is the name of the file.

A number in a file name indicates which of the cases in the article is considered in it. A suffix "alt" indicates that an alternative approach is taken.
